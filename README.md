### The new python library for UFACTORY

Currently only support Swift / Swift PRO,
and it's python3 only.

There are two way to use this library:

- Using the API wrapper just like the old `pyuarm` library,
  reference to [Swift API document](doc/swift_api.md), and [Swift API test script](test/test_swift_api.py).
- Using the [Modular Programming](doc/modular.md) prototype, and checkout all other scripts under `test/` folder.
