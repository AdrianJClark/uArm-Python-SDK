### The new python library for UFACTORY

Currently supports Swift / Swift PRO,
and it's python3 only.

There are two ways to use this library:

- Using the API wrapper just like the old `pyuarm` library,
- Using the API wrapper just like the old `pyuf` library,
  reference to [API documents](doc/api/), and scripts under `examples/api/` folder.

You may also want to read: [other documents](doc/).

#### Attention

Make sure you move the device head to a safe position and completely quit uArm Studio
before running the tests.

#### Installation

```
python3 setup.py install
```

Install is not necessary, you can run examples without installation.
